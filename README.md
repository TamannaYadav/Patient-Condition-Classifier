## Patient-Condition-Classifier

A machine learning project that predicts patient health conditions based on medical data and symptoms.
The system uses multiple algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest to classify patients into categories like:
 - Depression
 - Birth Control
 - High Blood Pressure
 - Diabetes (Type 2)

# Features

 - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
 - Multiple classification algorithms implemented
 - Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
 - Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
 - Confusion matrix visualization for detailed performance insights
 - Modular code for easy extension


# Results & Evaluation

 - Models compared: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Passive Regressive Model
 - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
 - Confusion matrices plotted for class-wise analysis
